LABEL istruction used to give some meta data information

For example assume that we have 20k images out of 20k you know just lable name and don't know about image name and other 
in such cases how do you find the image ? 

Here lable came to solve your problem you can easily filter with label

Ex :- docker images --filter "label= Email=chaithu.nampalli@gmail.com"
